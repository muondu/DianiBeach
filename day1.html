       <p>After we reached the hotel, we waited for our key to the room.Then I and found the beach and the swimming pool.I was happyy as a king.I went to tell my father.In a drop of a hat, we wore our swimming costume and then we went to the swimming pool.</p>
        <p>Then we went to the ocean.In the ocean some waves were small while others were huge.We like the big ones becoause we went underwater and the wave would push you rearward to the shore.</p>
		 <p>In the Afternoon you can it lunch at lunch time,playing or swimming inthe sswimming pool .You can go to play in the beach and relax.Many children play in the swimming pool.When it reaches 4 oclock.You can go to the ocean because it was starting to become high tide.There was also a watching point were you could enjoy watching the waves or go to the waves.You can stay in the swimming pool or go to have a snack.</p>
