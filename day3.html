 <h2>Morning</h2>     
     <p>The next day,we woke up prepared our self and then we wore our swimming costume to go to the ocean.We found it was low tide.A tour gide came and gave us a tour.</p>
<p>We saw many animals hidding under rocks. One of the animals we saw first was called sea urchin.The female ones were brown and the male ones are black.Another animal we saw was called a stone fish.It blends with the rocks because it has the same colour with the rocks.That's how it got its name.The stone fish has a poison spikes on their scales.Another animal we saw was a sea animal.Its protection is its gum.Sea animal has sticky gum which is poisonus to other animals excpt from Humans.We came back from the ocean and we went to the swimming pool.</p>
